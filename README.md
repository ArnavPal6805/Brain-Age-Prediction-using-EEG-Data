# Brain-Age-Prediction-using-EEG-Data
This project predicts brain age using EEG data. It preprocesses EEG signals, extracts features, and trains machine learning models like LightGBM and CatBoost to classify age groups (50-70). The repository includes scripts for data loading, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
